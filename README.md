# KNN-on-wine-datset
This report contains implementation and analysis of KNN algorithm on wine dataset. KNN algorithm predicts the outcome of each record in test data based on its k closest neighbors from the training data. The implementation consists of calculating the proximity measures of test data from the train data, choosing appropriate k value and some data transformations on the given data set.
